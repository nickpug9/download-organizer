Organizes download folder by exetensions

This is my first script in Python.

It utilizes the OS package to read/write/replace to the system's filesystem,
specifically, my downloads folder.

If you would like to run this on your own system, change the variables to your own path. The next version might include terminal input.

It also utilizes glob to get all of the files in the Downloads folder.
